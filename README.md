The full kit is composed of:
* **A commercially-available PCB holder from Aliexpress can be found here:** https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDVXjWL<br>

I tried 3 types of thicknesses... 1mm (white), 1.2mm (red) and 1.6mm (green). 
All of them works fine and even the 1mm thick version is robust!
Just upload the **gerber.zip** file on JLCPCB and you almost done ordering it. 👍<br>

The PIZZAbite PCB probes are mounted on flexible metal arm and a powerful magnet in the base for easy positioning. 
The one of the kind "lift and drop" function takes away the need for annoying and complicated set screws. 
Thanks to the extreme flexibility of the arms connected to the PIZZAbite PCBs, the compressible needle (a.k.a. PogoPin) maintain constant pressure at the probing point so even if the board is bumped into the probe tip will always stay in position.
